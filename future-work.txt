FUTURE WORK
===========

Features/Improvements:
-Add buffering to improve track playback, particularly "next track" on mobile
-Better organize catalog by type and or artist.
-Add randomness to laser show by hashing the album name and using the hash as the seed for the random number generator.
-AO process for managing catalogs.
-Implement "Load Catalog" feature to load an entirely custom catalog with different themes.
-Custom themes, "BYO CSS" for albums.
-Finalize tagging schema.
-Add support to load albums via **ArNS** (Arweave Name System) name.
-catalog.json linked via ArNS.


Maintenance:
-Check if ArDrive pins work in albums.
-Create a "test album" with different conditions.
-Verify album loading robustness against various track naming conventions:
     - Single/double-digit numbering.
     - Different file extensions (e.g., `.mp3`, `.wav`).
-Test app functionality with edge-case gateway URLs and **sandboxed subdomains**:
     - E.g., `65hkx5gp.arweave.net`, `frank.arweave.co.uk`.
